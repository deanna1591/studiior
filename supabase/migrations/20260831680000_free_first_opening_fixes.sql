-- =============================================================================
-- 163  Free-first opening fixes (Decision 30): one booking path, a real empty
--      state, the plan catalogue, and a free-class confirmation line.
-- =============================================================================
-- From the November-opening trace. No behaviour change unless free_first is on.
--
--  1. ONE booking path for an eligible member. The UI routes an eligible member
--     to book_first_free everywhere a Book renders; book_class is the belt —
--     it refuses a self-serve, free-first-eligible member with no active
--     membership (use_free_first) so an early-signed waiver can no longer let
--     the ordinary path spend the free class on a paid drop-in, and a direct
--     API call is caught too.
--  2. member_next_class_day — the member arm of next_class_day (which is
--     staff-only), so the /book empty state can say "Classes start {date}"
--     rather than "Try tomorrow", one day at a time.
--  3. booking_window_days + how_to_buy + contact reach the member app via
--     member_bootstrap, so /book can mark out-of-window classes "Opens for
--     booking on {date}" and /account/plan can show the catalogue and how to buy.
--  4. booking_confirmed gains a conditional free-first line.
-- =============================================================================

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. how_to_buy — the studio's own words for buying a plan (Decision 16: most
--    studios sell at the desk). Nullable; the app falls back to a default.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
alter table studio_settings add column if not exists how_to_buy text;
comment on column studio_settings.how_to_buy is
  'Decision 30/16. Shown on the member /account/plan under the plan catalogue. '
  'Null = the app''s default ("Ask at the desk and we''ll set you up").';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. member_bootstrap gains booking_window_days, how_to_buy and the studio
--    contact email — the /book window mark and the /account/plan buy line, in
--    the request every member screen already makes. RETURNS TABLE, so drop +
--    re-grant (rebuilt from migration 133).

  -- everyone else, not being shut out of the studio. A suspension that stopped
  -- somebody walking in would cost the studio the sale as well as the member the
  -- class, and it would be a harsher thing than any studio described wanting.
  --
  -- The allowance still applies on top: a suspension does not hand out free peak
  -- slots, and a member with nothing left is refused by the rule below whether
  -- or not they are suspended.
  --

  -- gate would mean a second plan-priority query beside the one rules 2 and 7
  -- use, and the two would pick the same plan right up until they did not —
  -- a member holding both an unlimited plan and a pack would have the pack's
  -- booking measured against the unlimited plan's allowance.
  --
  -- Only a membership can consume one. A drop-in and a pack cannot carry an
  -- allowance at all (migration 104's CHECK), so `v_pay = 'membership'` is not
  -- an optimisation, it is the rule.
  --
  -- peak_allowance_state() answers null for a plan with no allowance AND for a
  -- studio with the switch off, so a studio that has never heard of this
  -- feature takes one null check and nothing else.
  --
  -- WAITLISTING NEEDS NO SPECIAL CASE. This refuses before §4, so a member with
  -- nothing left cannot join the queue for a peak class either — which is the
  -- honest answer, rather than letting them wait for an offer they could not
  -- accept. And nothing is CONSUMED here: the ledger row is written by the
  -- trigger when a seat actually becomes real, so a waitlisted row costs
  -- nothing and a promotion costs one. `respond_to_offer()` cancels the
  -- waitlist row and calls this function again, so a promotion is measured
