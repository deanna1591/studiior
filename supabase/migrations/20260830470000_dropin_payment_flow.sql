-- Migration 037: a drop-in holds its seat while the member pays
-- =============================================================================
-- book_class() has never refused for payment. When nothing covers a class it
-- resolves §2.2 priority 4 to 'drop_in' and books the seat, leaving the charge
-- to "a payments row raised by the caller". With hosted Checkout the caller
-- redirects the member off-site, so that booking is a confirmed seat nobody has
-- paid for and may never come back to.
--
-- The seat is still held — taking someone's place away while they are typing a
-- card number is worse than briefly overstating how full a class is — but it is
-- held as 'pending_payment' (migration 036) rather than as 'booked'.
--
-- THREE CONSEQUENCES, each deliberate:
--
--   * It does not count toward the daily or forward booking limits. Those count
--     ('booked','waitlisted','attended','no_show') and 'pending_payment' is not
--     in the list. A member who abandons Checkout three times has not used up
--     three of today's classes.
--   * It DOES count as an existing live booking for the same class, so nobody
--     can open two checkouts for one seat. Same list as the partial unique
--     index below, which is widened to match.
--   * It sends no confirmation email. tg_queue_booking_notifications() fires on
--     `status = 'booked'` only, so the confirmation arrives when the webhook
--     flips the row — after the money, which is when it is true.
--
-- Both functions are replaced from their LIVE definitions (pg_get_functiondef),
-- not re-issued from the files that created them: book_class has been amended
-- by migrations 003 and 028 and the file text is three versions behind.
-- =============================================================================

-- The index that stops two live bookings for one class. Widened to include the
-- held seat, so the database refuses a second checkout even if a caller forgets.
