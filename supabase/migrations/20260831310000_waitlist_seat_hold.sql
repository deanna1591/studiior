-- §4.2: a pending waitlist offer HOLDS the seat, and this is what makes that
-- true. Migration 125 built the sweep and flagged this gap: book_class's
-- capacity gate reads booked_count, which counts real seats only — a waitlist
-- offer's booking stays 'waitlisted', so neither booked_count nor
-- occurrence_seats_taken includes it, and general booking could take the seat
-- from under a member who had been formally offered it. §4.2 is explicit that
-- the seat is held, not released to general booking, and an offer that can be
-- taken away is worse than no offer.
--
-- DERIVED AT GATE TIME, not cached. booked_count goes on counting real seats
-- only — so the nightly reconcile_booked_counts stays a no-op (it compares
-- booked_count to occurrence_seats_taken, neither of which changes here) — and
-- the hold ends the instant the offer does: accepted, declined, expired or
-- voided at the cutoff all clear it, and an expired-but-unswept offer (the
-- sweep runs every 5 minutes) holds nothing, because occurrence_seats_held
-- gates on expires_at > now(). A stale hold would be a permanently unbookable
-- seat, which is worse than the bug being fixed.
--
-- FRONT DESK is not held: the hold is folded into "full", and a desk override
-- (§14, a deliberate act with a reason) books straight through it — recorded as
-- 'held_seat' rather than 'capacity', since the class is not over capacity, the
-- desk simply took a reserved seat. The offer stands and fails on acceptance.

-- The one definition of "how many seats a live offer is holding". Excludes an
-- offer belonging to p_exclude_member: respond_to_offer cancels the waitlist
-- row and re-enters book_class while the member's own offer is still pending,
-- and counting it would refuse them the seat they were offered. Internal —
-- callable only by the SECURITY DEFINER functions below (and, being owned by
-- postgres, from inside them regardless of the client grant).

  -- a member holding both an unlimited plan and a pack would have the pack's
  -- booking measured against the unlimited plan's allowance.

  -- allowance at all (migration 104's CHECK), so `v_pay = 'membership'` is not
  -- an optimisation, it is the rule.
  --
  -- peak_allowance_state() answers null for a plan with no allowance AND for a
  -- studio with the switch off, so a studio that has never heard of this
  -- feature takes one null check and nothing else.

  -- WAITLISTING NEEDS NO SPECIAL CASE. This refuses before §4, so a member with
  -- nothing left cannot join the queue for a peak class either — which is the
  -- honest answer, rather than letting them wait for an offer they could not
  -- accept. And nothing is CONSUMED here: the ledger row is written by the
  -- trigger when a seat actually becomes real, so a waitlisted row costs
  -- nothing and a promotion costs one. `respond_to_offer()` cancels the
  -- waitlist row and calls this function again, so a promotion is measured
  -- against the allowance as it stands at that moment, not at join time.
