-- 085  Decision 22: the calendar shows the tier, and flags a standalone slot.
-- =============================================================================
-- The one thing the acceptance list asks for on a screen: "a standalone flex
-- slot is flagged". It is resolved in the reader the calendar already calls,
-- because a per-block fetch is the mistake the fullness work was careful not to
-- make.
--
-- The OUT parameters are additive, so app/staff/schedule/page.tsx keeps working
-- unchanged until it reads them.
