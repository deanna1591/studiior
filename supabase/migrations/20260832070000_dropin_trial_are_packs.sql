-- Decision 12 amendment — drop_in and trial activate as PACKS, never unlimited.
--
-- re-issues: activate_purchase(uuid, uuid, uuid, integer, character, text, text, boolean), book_class(uuid, uuid, booking_source, text, payment_source)
--
-- The bug: credits_remaining was `case type when 'class_pack' then plan.credits
-- else plan.credits_per_period end`. For a drop_in / trial, credits_per_period
-- is NULL (the plan_credits_per_period_recurring_only CHECK forces it), and
-- Decision 12 makes a NULL credits_per_period mean UNLIMITED — so a ₱100
-- one-class drop-in activated as unlimited, with no ledger rows and no expiry.
--
-- The fix: a pack-shaped plan (class_pack, drop_in, trial) is a finite bundle.
--   drop_in  -> exactly ONE credit (the decision: a drop-in is one class)
--   trial    -> coalesce(plan.credits, 1)
--   class_pack -> plan.credits (unchanged)
-- All three write the credit_ledger purchase row and set credits_remaining to
-- that count. expires_on: class_pack keeps its today+validity_days (NULL = no
-- expiry, unchanged); drop_in / trial get today + coalesce(validity_days, 30).
-- Only a recurring plan with a null allowance is unlimited. auto_renew stays
-- recurring-only; trial stays 'trialing'. Byte-for-byte the 20260831080000 body
-- otherwise. create-or-replace keeps the service-role-only ACL (re-asserted).

  -- gate would mean a second plan-priority query beside the one rules 2 and 7
  -- use, and the two would pick the same plan right up until they did not —
  -- a member holding both an unlimited plan and a pack would have the pack's
  -- booking measured against the unlimited plan's allowance.
  --
  -- Only a membership can consume one. A drop-in and a pack cannot carry an
  -- allowance at all (migration 104's CHECK), so `v_pay = 'membership'` is not
  -- an optimisation, it is the rule.
  --
  -- peak_allowance_state() answers null for a plan with no allowance AND for a
  -- studio with the switch off, so a studio that has never heard of this
  -- feature takes one null check and nothing else.
  --
  -- WAITLISTING NEEDS NO SPECIAL CASE. This refuses before §4, so a member with
  -- nothing left cannot join the queue for a peak class either — which is the
  -- honest answer, rather than letting them wait for an offer they could not
  -- accept. And nothing is CONSUMED here: the ledger row is written by the
  -- trigger when a seat actually becomes real, so a waitlisted row costs
  -- nothing and a promotion costs one. `respond_to_offer()` cancels the
